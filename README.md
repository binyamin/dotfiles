# :card_index_dividers: Dotfiles
> My personal set of linux configuration files

- I use [yadm](https://yadm.io/docs/overview) for managing my dotfiles. It's a wrapper for git, plus it will symlink the files for you.
- If you want to make your own dotfiles, have a look at <http://dotfiles.github.io>
